### Forge an almost properly RSA-signed JWT token
1.  Download the public JWT key from `http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys/jwt.pub`.
2.  Using a tool like Burp Suite with the "JSON Web Token Attacker" extension, modify the email in a captured JWT payload to `rsa_lord@juice-sh.op`.
3.  In the attacker tab, use the "Key Confusion" attack, loading the public key. This tricks the server into using the public key to verify a token signed with the same public key (as if it were a symmetric key).
4.  Send the modified request to solve the challenge.
